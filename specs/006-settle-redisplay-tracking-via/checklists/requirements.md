# Specification Quality Checklist: Settle Redisplay Tracking via Wall-Clock Timeout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed: the wall-clock threshold value has a direct,
  reasonable default (the `MAX_WATCH_DURATION_MS` precedent from ad-serve-client#8), and the
  feature's scope is fully bounded by the existing bug report (ad-serve-client#9) and existing
  redisplay-resilience requirements (FR-008/009/010 from 002-resilient-slot-discovery) it must not
  regress.
